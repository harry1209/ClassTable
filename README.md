# ClassTable
The objective of this class table project is to implement a class timetable app for Android users. Its main goal is to make a class timetable for each student to check on the phone. It can also set alarms to remind students to take class on time. Whatâ€™s more, students
can use this app to make a phone call or text teachers directly to ask for leave automatically.
